*SOMETHING TO REMEMBER: DESIGNS CAN BE AMAZING IN ASPECTS OTHER THAN GRAPHICS*
* TODO
** DONE get org mode working
*** TODO get org mode to be better
** DONE stop movement when aiming, (movement goes to crosshair)
** TODO hp bars
** DONE cmake
** TODO cmake for app bundle
** TODO MAKE BOX CLASS (FOR BOTH BOWMEN AND CROSSHAIR, for physics)
** TODO magit
   
 anOther Design:
 - ESKETIT (not in bowman)
   - perhaps fortnite building mechanics
   - grenades ass projectiles
 - simulation stock market (kind similar to rotmg trading scheme)
 - april foods reddit pixel game (with groups like void, etc.)

 - every 5 seconds you get a clone (in inventory)
   - each clone has 1 life, player has 3
  - crosshair is the target of all clones
 - friendly fire on (clones hitting other clones and yourself)
   - shot is a laser beam (upgrade with pierce, duration, width, etc.)
     - physics: laser applies force/torque at collision point
       - friction on floor (this is essentially topdowner)
         - square on square collision constraints
     - make a timer in game counting down by 5s.
       
       # FOCUS on rendering every line of fire created by clone, then work on collisions
 - rework collison
 - clones should be meat shields
 - have clones shoot projectiles instead of lines

 *(worry about graphics, animations, and physics later)*
------------
ANIMATIONS:
summoning clone (particles drawn to one point)
death explosion (into tiny squares)
projectile trail (or gradient of path)
------------
PHYSICS:
translation and rotation apon impact, along with friction

 - try using cmake to build an app, then change NSHighResolutionCapable to True in Info.plist

   - extra effects:
     - crosshair is also hittable by laser
       - different powerups available such as ...
         - particle effects when shooting laser
   - add mode where you control clones in a certain radius from yourself
     

- joshOG game incentives (seen in fortnite, not pubg)
  - leveling up
  - unlocking skins 

- factions / cell grid
  - use "/f map" as main screen (see photo on desktop)
  - (each block can be a certain type of room/wall)
  - there can be different layers of "/f map" screen (to mimick 3d-ness)
  - maybe option to enter landscape mode from "/f map" screen
  - YES MONACO WORKS!
