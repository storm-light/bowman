*SOMETHING TO REMEMBER: DESIGNS CAN BE AMAZING IN ASPECTS OTHER THAN GRAPHICS*
* TODO
** DONE get org mode working
** TODO stop movement when aiming, (movement goes to crosshair)
** TODO hp bar
** TODO cmake
** TODO git
   
 anOther Design:
 - ESKETIT (not in bowman)
   - perhaps fortnite building mechanics
   - grenades ass projectiles
 - simulation stock market (kind similar to rotmg trading scheme)
 - april foods reddit pixel game (with groups like void, etc.)

 - every 5 seconds you get a clone (in inventory)
   - each clone has 1 life, player has 3
  - crosshair is the target of all clones
 - friendly fire on (clones hitting other clones and yourself)
   - shot is a laser beam (upgrade with pierce, duration, width, etc.)
     - physics: laser applies force/torque at collision point
       - friction on floor (this is essentially topdowner)
         - square on square collision constraints
     - make a timer in game counting down by 5s.

 (worry about graphics later)      
 - try using cmake to build an app, then change NSHighResolutionCapable to True in Info.plist
